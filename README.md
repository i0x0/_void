# `Void`: a blockchain based around storing data

## [Tutorial](https://hackernoon.com/learn-blockchains-by-building-one-117428612f46)

It is based around the tutorial but instead of transactions, its based around immutable data

### TODO

- [ ] Limit-rate the api?
- [ ] Actually make a somewhat client of the blockchain
  - [ ] Make a client-side miner?
- [ ] Organize codebase?
  - [ ] Make comments in code lol
- [ ] Make the same implementation in a different language?
- [ ] Make logs pretty
